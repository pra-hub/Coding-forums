Non-functional Requirements
Because the design patterns of the Online Ordering System are pretty much the standardfor a web application, the non-functional requirements of the system are very straightforward.Although written using google web toolkit, the application is cross-compiled to html and JavaScript, along with a ** backend, all of which are supported by any reasonably wellmaintained web server, although  would recommend ApacheB, and particularly the free CA)**distribution.All of the application data is stored in a *ostgreS=: database, and therefore a*ostgreS=: server must also be installed on the host computer. As with ApacheB, this software isfreely available and can be installed and run under most operating systems.the server hardware can be any computer capable of running both the web and databaseservers and handling the expected traffic. For a restaurant that is not expecting to see much webtraffic, or possibly doing only a limited test run, an average personal computer may beappropriate. Once the site starts generating more hits, though, it will likely be necessary toupgrade to a dedicated host to ensure proper performance. the exact cutoffs will need to bedetermined through a more thorough stress testing of the system.
